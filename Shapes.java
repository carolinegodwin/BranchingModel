//
// This program allows you to draw any shape by reading from a file named control.txt
// The first number in the program is the number of vertices the shape will have
// 0 is a circle, 1 is a point, 2 is a line, 3 is triangle, 4 is a square, and 5 is a pentagon
// circles are blue, triangles are red, squares are orange, and everything else is magenta
// 
// The second number is the radius - the screen size is determined by the radius size
// The third number is the number of times the shape is to be copied and rotated around the center
//
// The only thing that I could not get to work completely is the centering of the object in the Jframe
// It is centering on the x axis, but not on the y axis. I couldn't figure out why.
//

//JDevelop 3 is where we branch into the feature branches!
